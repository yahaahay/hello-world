Hi Aaron!
I hope you are doing well and this reaches you in the best of health and spirit.  I know this stuff is starting off *really* rough(!), but I'm hoping and praying for you that it's getting easier and mor fulfilling, and you don't feel like you're drowning in code ;-p Okay, let's get a move on...! Just trying to get this in and done to work on other stuff... and hey- hang in there bud!
